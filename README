CIDE - the "Collaborative Integrated Development Environment" - is a free, open-source and web-based IDE where everything is executed on the server.


About the project
=================

CIDE is centered around the idea that collaboration is very important in computer science. It is designed to enable developers to work on a given piece of code at the same time.

The project was initiated during the last weeks of our engineering studies and is going to endure a lot of refactoring before it's ready for a first alpha release.

More info to come in the next weeks.


Origins
=======

The project was originally developed by four students studying Computer Engineering at ECE Paris (Alexandre Trufanow, Guillaume Brunier, Gabriel FÃ©ron and Fabien Bavent).
